In this work we implement a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model. 
It makes use of both continuous and discrete variables, thus it is a Joint VAE model.

To recreate our model - run `main.py`

To reproduce our model - run `reproduce_hw3.py`

The `main.py` code makes use of `ax` package. 
Make sure to install it!

The code assumes the folder `data` to exist in the same directoy.
`data` should have a folder `img_align_celeba` inside with the celebA dataset.
